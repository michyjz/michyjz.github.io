I'm Michael, an incoming freshman at the University of Texas at Austin, where I'm studying computer science in the Turing Scholars Honors Program.

I enjoy competitive programming and artificial intelligence/machine learning.

Some other hobbies I have are tennis, chess, speedcubing, guitar, and video games!

# Tutoring
I tutor CS and math (including USACO and AMC) for middle and high school students, and I'm availaable for online and in-person (Bay Area only).
