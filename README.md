# Michy's Website
Hi!\n

I'm Michael, an incoming freshman at the University of Texas at Austin, where I'm studying computer science in the Turing Scholars Honors Program.\n

I enjoy competitive programming and artificial intelligence/machine learning, and I'm also trying to learn web development.\n

Some other hobbies I have are tennis, speedcubing, chess, k-pop, and anime!\n

Feel free to reach out to me on Discord @michyjz or Instagram @michael.jxu\n
