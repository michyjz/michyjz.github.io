# Introduction
Hey!

I'm Michael, an incoming freshman at the University of Texas at Austin, where I'm studying computer science in the Turing Scholars Honors Program.

I enjoy competitive programming and artificial intelligence/machine learning, and I'm also trying to learn web development.

Some other hobbies I have are tennis, speedcubing, chess, video games, and anime!

# Projects
Once I start working on some projects, I'll post them here!
