# Introduction
Hey!

![Firefly from HSR](https://preview.redd.it/firefly-chibi-firefly-chibi-firefly-chibi-firefly-chibi-v0-e9kskta40e4d1.jpeg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=5aad12ff656fe2b6a30683418b7f8a1c5c9e2cb3)

I'm Michael, an incoming freshman at the University of Texas at Austin, where I'm studying computer science in the Turing Scholars Honors Program.

I enjoy competitive programming and artificial intelligence/machine learning, and I'm also trying to learn web development.

Some other hobbies I have are tennis, speedcubing, chess, video games, and anime!

# Projects
Once I start working on some projects, I'll post them here!
