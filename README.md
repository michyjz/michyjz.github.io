# Introduction
Hey!

I'm Michael, an incoming freshman at the University of Texas at Austin, where I'm studying computer science in the Turing Scholars Honors Program.

I enjoy competitive programming and artificial intelligence/machine learning.

Some other hobbies I have are tennis, chess, speedcubing, guitar, and video games!

# Achievements

I'm a USACO Platinum competitor (passed USACO Gold on the December 2023 contest with a full score of 1000), achieved a perfect score on the AP Computer Science A Exam in 2023, and a 2025 National Merit Scholarship Finalist.

# Tutoring
I tutor math and CS for middle and high school students.

Some past experience I have is TA for X-Camp Academy USACO Silver Camp and 400 level classes, as well as peer tutoring for 3 years at my high school.

I'm available for online and in-person (Bay Area only). If you're interested for a private session (first one is free!) please check out [MX Tutoring](https://sites.google.com/view/mxtutoring).

# Projects
Here are a few of the projects I've worked on the past, mainly from high school classes like AP Computer Science A and ADEN.

# Speedcubing

One of my favorite hobbies is speedcubing, or solving Rubik's Cubes as fast as possible. My WCA ID is 2015XUJI03, but I really only seriously started getting back into cubing this year. My favorite events are 3x3 and skewb.
