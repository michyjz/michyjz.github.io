# Introduction
Hey!

I'm Michael, an incoming freshman at the University of Texas at Austin, where I'm studying computer science in the Turing Scholars Honors Program.

I enjoy competitive programming and artificial intelligence/machine learning.

Some other hobbies I have are tennis, chess, speedcubing, guitar, and video games!

# Achievements

I am a USACO Platinum competitor (passed USACO Gold on the December 2023 contest with a full score of 1000), a perfect scorer on the AP Computer Science A Exam in 2023, and a 2025 National Merit Scholarship Finalist.

# Tutoring
I tutor math and CS for middle and high school students.

My experiences include being a teacher for X-Camp Academy USACO Bronze Camp, TA for Silver and 400 level classes, as well as peer tutoring for 3 years at my high school.
